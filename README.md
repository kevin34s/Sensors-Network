This program was part of a graded practical course on sensor networks. This course is given in the 4th year of engineering school at INSA Hauts-de-France, specializing in Embedded Systems Electronics.

NB: The 4th year of engineering school is equivalent to Master 1 level.

The TP problem was as follows:

Reducing energy consumption in communicating networks is a major objective if we wish to increase network autonomy. 
This is particularly important in the case of sensor networks, where maintenance-free lifetimes of up to five years are targeted. 
We therefore seek to define the optimum means of transmitting information from point A to point B at the lowest possible cost. 
For a given channel, we calculate and compare the energy cost of single-hop and multi-hop communication
